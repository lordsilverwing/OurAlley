    <h1>About Our Alley</h1>
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>
    It started with an idea for a website that would connect neighbors together, to increase
    community building. The best way to connect with others and to foster those relationships is to
    find a mutual love for something. We decided dogs would be this entry point as dogs are pretty awesome.
    That then led to the idea of establishing playdates for those dogs. Cast away the frivolity of 
    human society, embrace dog society! Build healthy dog communities where are four legged best friends
    can thrive!
    </p>
    <h3>What is OurAlley?</h3>
    <p>
        Simply put, it is a place where you can see dogs in your area and set up playdates with them for your dog.
        Either set up your own playdates or receive ones from others. You can also see details about each dog
        so you can find the perfect match for your best friend!
    </p>
    <h3>A Dog Community</h3>
    <p>
        Dogs and humans are not so different when it comes to socialization. Sure we may be fancier
        and more sophisticated, however, the basics remain the same. That is what we want to foster for our
        companions, a place that you can arrange for them to have a good time. Hopefully your dogs will love it
        and by extension improve your overall quality of life at home!
    </p>
    <h3>Should I use OurAlley?</h3>
    <p>
        Personally I have only one dog and he yearns to socialize with other furry four-legged beings. We bipedal beings
        just get boring sometimes. If you are in the same boat as me or have multiple dogs who just need to spice
        things up then I recommend you sign up today. Do it for them.
